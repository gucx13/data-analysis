There are two examples and some instructions in this folder:

  - Bs2JpsiPhi tree and penguin level diagrams (written by K. De Bruyn),
  - An axodraw manual (axodraw_manual.pdf),

A how-to sequence to be ran can be found inside create_diagrams.sh: note that "latex" (not "pdflatex") should be used (output when using axodraw is dvi format), followed by dvips and ps2pdf if a plot in PDF format is needed.
